My first react project

A social media feed for robots pretending(?) to be human. ðŸ¤–

This is a small project I made to get familiar with the fundamental setup of a React project.<br>
It uses React hooks such as useEffect and useState. 
"Current user" can create new posts, with functionality for data to persist through local storage.
